                        <p>
                        When I was offered a position as a GIS Tutor for the Fall 2019 semester, I admit that I was nervous.  My undergraduate studies were in a very different field – Linguistics – and I had only discovered the concept of GIS while browsing a list of graduate degrees offered by Temple University, where I am now expected to graduate next month.  I had always loved maps, and while GIS is much more than cartography, I admit that the idea of being a professional mapmaker intrigued me.  At 26, I was feeling directionless, like so many others in my generation, and I was looking for a change.   So I decided to try some GIS classes at a local community college, and I quickly found that it was something that sparked my interest and my creativity.</p>
                            
                            
                        <p>At a year into my Professional Science Master’s program at Temple, I was intimidated by the idea of teaching others.  My grades were solid and I understood the material, but I felt that there was no way I could solve other people’s problems while I was still learning.  This is where I was wrong- becoming a department tutor was exactly what I needed to take my education to the next level.  It is very easy to put off solving your own academic problems, but when someone approaches you for help, it creates a heightened sense of urgency.</p>
                    
                        <p>As the GIS tutor for a full academic year, I was able to work through the introductory GIS class <italic>three additional times</italic> – and to see exactly what tripped people up about every single assignment and concept.  I learned how to describe the distinction between a datum, a coordinate system, and a projection.  I saw exactly why students’ joins, queries, and geoprocessing tools failed, and I learned how to fix them.  I was able to see all the design choices that people made, and to look at my projects differently as a result. </p>
                        
                        <p>I thought that nobody would seek out GIS tutoring, but as the semester progressed, more and more students were in my lab hours, a mix of regulars and pop-ins.  My absolute most memorable day in my first semester of tutoring was just before finals, when I worked with students on their final projects.  I saw what drove people to study GIS, and I helped them transform their interests into achievable first-semester final projects. It was so inspiring to see students studying housing inequality, education systems, ecological preservation, archaeology, and a multitude of other important social and environmental issues.</p>
                        
                        <p>As I became more comfortable in my tutoring role, I felt it was important to encourage students to keep persisting with GIS even if they weren’t “computer people” – a common complaint.  I tried to communicate to students that GIS, data science, and coding become easier as you progress, not harder.  I encouraged learning R, Python and SQL, describing them as tools, not obstacles, that have enriched my work and education.  New programs, modules and languages allow you to do your job with less hassle and far greater accuracy.  As I stressed the learning curve and persistence to students, I realized I was also encouraging myself – and that this was something I really needed.  I have come a long way in year, and I can largely thank my tutoring job for that.</p>
